	<p> Roofus was taken from an abusive "home,"<br> after animal control was called on his<br> past owners. His past owners kept him <br>chained up, outside, and was barely feed<br> for most of his life. He was even found<br> with cuts along his body. We found roofus<br> at Barc, and told the organization we wanted<br> to give him an opportunity to find a great<br> home. Now he's excitedly waiting for his<br> new loving owners! <p>
